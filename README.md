# Neural Pathway Analysis of Cognitive Tasks

This repository analyzes how different cognitive tasks manifest in the neural activations of the DeepSeek-R1 model through layer-wise activation patterns.

## Cognitive Task Taxonomy

The 15 cognitive categories and their focus areas:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Vision** | Visual perception, spatial relationships, and object recognition |
| **Math** | Arithmetic operations, problem solving, and mathematical reasoning |
| **Language** | Linguistic creativity, translation, and semantic understanding |
| **Emotion** | Emotional recognition, social intelligence, and affective states |
| **Pattern Recognition** | Sequence completion, analogies, and logical patterns |
| **Logical Reasoning** | Deductive/inductive reasoning, syllogisms, and paradox resolution |
| **Spatial Reasoning** | Mental rotation, 3D visualization, and spatial transformations |
| **Creative Thinking** | Divergent thinking, metaphorical reasoning, and idea generation |
| **Social Intelligence** | Theory of mind, social norms, and interpersonal dynamics |
| **Working Memory** | Information maintenance and manipulation under load |
| **Executive Function** | Planning, task switching, and cognitive control |
| **Spatial Navigation** | Pathfinding, mental mapping, and orientation |
| **Temporal Processing** | Time estimation, event sequencing, and rhythm perception |
| **Decision Making** | Risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and uncertainty |
| **Motor Planning** | Action sequencing and kinesthetic imagination |

## Methodology

1. **Stimulus Presentation**: 200+ questions across 15 categories ([full list](questions.json))
2. **Activation Capture**: Layer-wise mean activations sampled every 4 layers
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: UMAP projection to 2D space
4. **Visualization**: Color-coded trajectory plots showing layer progression
